                              compute, storage and network resources delivered as a service) is still maturing and
                              rapidly evolving. Strategic providers must therefore be chosen carefully.

                        <p>Cloud computing is a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities
                           are delivered as a service using Internet technologies. Cloud infrastructure as a
                           service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service; it parallels the infrastructure
                           and data center initiatives of IT. Cloud compute IaaS constitutes the largest segment
                           of this market (the broader IaaS market also includes cloud storage and cloud printing).
                           Only cloud compute IaaS is evaluated in this Magic Quadrant; it does not cover cloud
                           storage providers, platform as a service (PaaS) providers, software as a service (SaaS)
                           providers, cloud services brokerages or any other type of cloud service provider,
                           nor does it cover the hardware and software vendors that may be used to build cloud
                           infrastructure. Furthermore, this Magic Quadrant is not an evaluation of the broad,
                           generalized cloud computing strategies of the companies profiled.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the context of this Magic Quadrant, cloud compute IaaS (hereafter referred to simply
                           as "cloud IaaS" or "IaaS") is defined as a standardized, highly automated offering,
                           where compute resources, complemented by storage and networking capabilities, are
                           owned by a service provider and offered to the customer on demand. The resources are
                           scalable and elastic in near real time, and metered by use. Self-service interfaces
                           are exposed directly to the customer, including a Web-based UI and an API. The resources
                           may be single-tenant or multitenant, and hosted by the service provider or on-premises
                           in the customer's data center.
                        </p>
                        <p>We draw a distinction between cloud infrastructure <em>as a service</em>, and cloud infrastructure <em>as a</em> <em>technology platform</em>;
 we call the latter cloud-enabled system infrastructure (CESI). In cloud
 IaaS, the
                           capabilities of a CESI are directly exposed 
to the customer through self-service.
                           However, other services, including noncloud 
services, may be delivered on top of a
                           CESI; these cloud-enabled services may 
include forms of managed hosting, data center
                           outsourcing and other IT outsourcing 
services. In this Magic Quadrant, we evaluate
                           only cloud IaaS offerings; we do not evaluate
 cloud-enabled services. (See "Technology Overview for Cloud-Enabled 
System Infrastructure," "Technology Overview for Cloud-Enabled Managed 
Hosting" and "Don't Be Fooled by Offerings Falsely Masquerading as Cloud
 Infrastructure as a Service" for more on this distinction.)
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant covers all the common use cases for cloud IaaS, including development
                           and testing, production environments (including those supporting mission-critical
                           workloads) for both internal and customer-facing applications, batch computing (including
                           high-performance computing [HPC]) and disaster recovery. It encompasses both single-application
                           workloads and "virtual data centers" (VDCs) hosting many diverse workloads. It includes
                           suitability for a wide range of application design patterns, including both "cloud-native"
                           application architectures and enterprise application architectures.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant primarily evaluates cloud IaaS providers in the context of the
                           fastest-growing need among Gartner clients: the desire to have a "data center in the
                           cloud," where the customer retains most of the IT operations responsibility. Gartner's
                           clients are mainly enterprises, midmarket businesses and technology companies of all
                           sizes, and the evaluation focuses on typical client requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant strongly emphasizes 
self-service and automation in a standardized
                           environment. It focuses on the needs of 
customers whose primary need is self-service
                           cloud IaaS, although it may be supplemented 
by a small amount of colocation or dedicated
                           servers. Organizations that need significant 
customization or managed services for
                           a single application, or that are seeking 
cloud IaaS as a supplement to a traditional
                           hosting solution ("hybrid hosting"), should 
consult the Magic Quadrants for Managed
                           Hosting instead ("Magic Quadrant for Managed 
Hosting, North America," "Magic Quadrant for European Managed Hosting" 
and "Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Enabled Managed Hosting, Asia/Pacific"). 
Organizations that do not want self-service, but instead want managed 
services
                           with an underlying CESI, should consult our 
Magic Quadrants for data center outsourcing
                           and infrastructure utility services ("Magic 
Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Infrastructure Utility 
Services, North
                           America," "Magic Quadrant for Data Center 
Outsourcing and Infrastructure Utility Services, Europe" and "Magic 
Quadrant for Data Center Outsourcing and Infrastructure Utility 
Services, Asia/Pacific").
                        </p>
                        <p>This Magic Quadrant evaluates only solutions that are delivered in an entirely standardized
                           fashion — specifically, public cloud IaaS, along with private cloud IaaS that uses
                           the same or a highly similar platform. Although most of the providers in this Magic
                           Quadrant do offer custom private cloud IaaS, we have not considered these offerings
                           in our evaluations. Organizations that are looking for custom-built, custom-managed
                           private clouds should use our Magic Quadrants for data center outsourcing and infrastructure
                           utility services instead (see above).

                        </h3>
                        <p>IaaS providers that target enterprise and midmarket customers generally offer a high-quality
                           service, with excellent availability, good performance, high security and good customer
                           support. Exceptions will be noted in this Magic Quadrant's evaluations of individual
                           providers. Note that when we say "all providers," we specifically mean "all the evaluated
                           providers included in this Magic Quadrant," not all cloud IaaS providers in general.
                           Keep the following in mind when reading the vendor profiles:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>All of the providers have a public cloud IaaS offering. Many also have an industrialized
                              private cloud offering, where every customer is on standardized infrastructure and
                              cloud management tools, although this may or may not resemble the provider's public
                              cloud service in either architecture or quality. A single architecture and feature
                              set and cross-cloud management, for both public and private cloud IaaS, make it easier
                              for customers to combine and migrate across service models as their needs dictate,
                              and enable the provider to use its engineering investments more effectively. All the
                              providers also offer custom private clouds, unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers are oriented toward the needs of traditional IT operations,
                              with an emphasis on control, governance and security, and the ability to run both
                              new applications and legacy workloads. The providers that are oriented toward the
                              needs of developers are noted as such; these providers typically emphasize easy access
                              to infrastructure for individuals who are building new applications. Some developer-oriented
                              offerings target small or midsize businesses (SMBs) and startups, and lack the features
                              needed by enterprises and midmarket entities.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers have resilient infrastructure, achieved through redundant infrastructure
                              in conjunction with virtual machine (VM) clustering, or the ability to rapidly detect
                              VM failure and immediately restart it on different hardware. They are thus able to
                              offer very high SLAs for infrastructure availability — sometimes as high as 99.999%
                              (sometimes expressed as a 100% SLA with a 10-minute exclusion). Offerings without
                              VM clustering or fast VM restart — which provide higher levels of infrastructure availability
                              than can be expected from a single physical server — are noted as lacking autorestart.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers have maintenance windows that result in downtime of the control
                              plane (including the GUI and API), and may require infrastructure downtime. Some offerings
                              can utilize live migration of VMs, largely eliminating the need for downtime to perform
                              host maintenance, but this does not eliminate maintenance windows in general.
                           </li>
                           <li>In general, monthly compute availability SLAs of 99.95% and higher are the norm, and
                              they are typically higher than availability SLAs for managed hosting. Service credits
                              for outages in a given month are typically capped at 100% of the monthly bill. This
                              availability percentage is typically non-negotiable, as it is based on an engineering
                              estimate of the underlying infrastructure reliability. Maintenance windows are normally
                              excluded from the SLA.
                           </li>
                           <li>Some providers have a compute availability SLA that requires the customer to use compute
                              capabilities in at least two fault domains (sometimes known as availability zones
                              or availability sets); an SLA violation requires both fault domains to fail. Providers
                              with an SLA of this type are explicitly noted as having a multi-fault-domain SLA.
                           </li>
                           <li>Very few of the providers have an SLA for compute or storage performance. However,
                              most of the providers do not oversubscribe compute or RAM resources; providers that
                              do not guarantee resource allocations are noted explicitly. Storage performance varies
                              considerably between providers. Some providers can offer tiered storage with a solid-state
                              drive (SSD) option.
                           </li>
                           <li>Many providers have additional SLAs, covering network availability and performance,
                              customer service responsiveness and other service aspects.
                           </li>
                           <li>Infrastructure resources are not normally automatically replicated into multiple data
                              centers unless otherwise noted; customers are responsible for their own business continuity.
                              Some providers offer optional disaster recovery solutions.
                           </li>
                           <li>All providers offer, at minimum, per-hour metering of VMs, and some can offer shorter
                              metering increments, which can be more cost-effective for short-term batch jobs. Providers
                              charge on a per-VM basis unless otherwise noted. Some providers offer either a shared
                              resource pool (SRP) pricing model or are flexible about how they price the service.
                              In the SRP model, customers contract for a certain amount of capacity (in terms of
                              CPU and RAM), but can allocate that capacity to VMs in an arbitrary way, including
                              being able to oversubscribe that capacity voluntarily; additional capacity can usually
                              be purchased on demand by the hour.
                           </li>
                           <li>Some of the providers allow customers to choose arbitrary-size VMs — any combination
                              of virtual CPUs (vCPUs), RAM and VM storage, subject to some limits. Providers that
                              do not allow this are explicitly noted as offering fixed-size VMs. Some providers
                              with fixed-size VMs have a very limited range of VM sizes, while others have a wide
                              variety of sizes and suit a broad range of use cases. Some providers who offer arbitrary-size
                              VMs may enforce a maximum ratio between vCPUs and RAM.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers can resize an existing VM without needing to reprovision it;
                              those that cannot are explicitly noted as offering nonresizable VMs. Some of the providers
                              can resize an existing VM without needing to reboot it.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers can provision a basic Linux VM within 5 minutes (although this
                              will increase with large OS images, and Windows VMs typically take somewhat longer).
                              Those that cannot are noted as having slow provisioning. Most providers can do simultaneous
                              provisioning of multiple VMs; for example, provisioning 20 VMs will finish about as
                              quickly as one VM. Those that cannot are noted as such, and the degradation can be
                              significant (some providers take over an hour to provision 20 VMs). Nonsimultaneous
                              provisioning has a major negative impact in disaster recovery, instant high-scalability
                              and batch-computing scenarios.
                           </li>
                           <li>Some of the providers are able to offer an option for single-tenant VMs within a public
                              cloud IaaS offering, on a fully dynamic basis, where a customer can choose to place
                              a VM on a host that is temporarily physically dedicated to just that customer, without
                              the customer needing to buy a VM that is so large that it consumes the whole physical
                              host. These VMs are typically more expensive than VMs on shared hosts. Providers that
                              have this option are noted as such.
                           </li>
                           <li>Some of the providers are able to offer "bare metal" physical servers on a dynamic
                              basis. Due to the longer provisioning times involved for physical equipment (two hours
                              is common), the minimum billing increment for such servers is usually daily, rather
                              than hourly. Providers with a bare-metal option are noted as such.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer an option for colocation, unless otherwise noted. Many customers
                              have needs that require a small amount of supplemental colocation in conjunction with
                              their cloud — most frequently for a large-scale database, but sometimes for specialized
                              network equipment, software that cannot be licensed on virtualized servers, or legacy
                              equipment. Colocation is specifically mentioned only when a service provider actively
                              sells colocation as a stand-alone service; a significant number of midmarket customers
                              plan to move into colocation and then gradually migrate into that provider's IaaS
                              offering.
                           </li>
                           <li>Typically, the storage associated with an individual VM is persistent. However, some
                              providers have ephemeral storage, where the storage exists only during the life of
                              the VM; if the VM goes away unexpectedly (for instance, due to hardware failure),
                              all data in that storage is lost. Ephemeral storage is always noted explicitly.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer VM-independent block storage unless otherwise noted. A few
                              providers allow storage volumes to be mounted on multiple VMs simultaneously, although
                              customers must correctly architect their solutions to ensure data integrity (just
                              as they would with a traditional storage array).
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer object-based cloud storage, unless otherwise noted. In many
                              cases, this service is integrated with a content delivery network (CDN).
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers have a private WAN that connects their data centers, unless otherwise
                              noted. They offer an option for private network connectivity (usually in the form
                              of Multiprotocol Label Switching [MPLS] or Ethernet purchased from the customer's
                              choice of carrier), between their cloud environment and the customer's premises, unless
                              otherwise noted. Providers for which we state "third-party connectivity is via partner
                              exchanges" are ones where private connectivity is obtained via cross-connect in the
                              data centers of select partners, such as Equinix; this also meets the needs of customers
                              who require colocated equipment. Some carriers may also have special products for
                              connecting to specific cloud providers — for example, AT&amp;T NetBond and Verizon Secure
                              Cloud Interconnect.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers support the use of Internet-based IPsec VPN (virtual private
                              networking). All the providers allow customers to have VMs with only private Internet
                              Protocol (IP) addresses (no public Internet connectivity), and also allow customers
                              to use their own IP address ranges, unless otherwise noted. Some providers may enforce
                              secure access to management consoles, restricting access to VPNs or private connectivity.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers claim to have high security standards. The extent of the security
                              controls provided to customers varies significantly, though. All providers offer multifactor
                              authentication (MFA), unless otherwise noted. Most providers offer additional security
                              services. All the providers evaluated can offer solutions that will meet common regulatory
                              compliance needs, unless otherwise noted. All the providers have SSAE 16 audits for
                              their data centers (see Note 1), and some may have ISO 27001 audits for their cloud
                              IaaS offering (see Note 2); audits should not be taken as indications of security.
                           </li>
                           <li>Most providers offer a firewall (intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system)
                              as part of their offering, although a few offer only access control lists (ACLs) and
                              a few offer no self-service network security at all; this will always be explicitly
                              noted. All providers provide distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigation,
                              unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer customers a self-service ability to create complex network
                              topologies with multiple network segments and multiple virtual network interface cards
                              (NICs), unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers allow customers to bring their own VM images, unless otherwise noted.
                              This allows a customer to create snapshots of existing VMs within their own internal
                              data center, and then directly import them via self-service into the provider's cloud,
                              rather than having to start from the provider's own VM image library. This also allows
                              the import of VM appliances and other prepackaged VM images from independent software
                              vendors (ISVs). All providers allow storage snapshots and have the ability to turn
                              the snapshot into a VM image, unless otherwise noted. All the providers have the ability
                              to do bulk import and export of data on physical media, unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>Some providers allow customers to create provisioning templates that group multiple
                              resources, including compute, storage and network elements, and allow them to be provisioned
                              as a unit. Some of the providers also have post-provisioning hooks, allowing customers
                              to run scripts after VM provisioning is complete but before the VM is available for
                              login.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer self-service monitoring as an option, unless otherwise noted.
                              A few offer trigger-based autoscaling, which allows provisioning-related actions to
                              be taken based on a monitored event. Some providers offer schedule-based autoscaling,
                              which allows provisioning-related actions to be executed at a particular time.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer self-service, front-end load balancing, unless otherwise noted.
                              All also offer back-end load balancing (used to distribute load across the middle
                              and back-end tiers of an application), unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers offer a portal and self-service mechanism that is designed for multiple
                              users and that offers hierarchical administration and role-based access control (RBAC).
                              However, the degree of RBAC granularity varies greatly. From most to least control,
                              RBAC can be per element, tag, group or account. Unless stated otherwise, a provider's
                              RBAC applies across the account. Providers typically predefine some roles; the ability
                              to have customer-defined roles offers more control, and is noted where available.
                              We strongly recommend that customers that need these features, but that want to use
                              a provider that does not have strong support for them, evaluate a third-party management
                              tool, such as Dell Cloud Manager (formerly Enstratius), RightScale or ServiceMesh
                              (acquired by CSC).
                           </li>
                           <li>All providers log events such as resource provisioning and deprovisioning, VM start
                              and stop, and account changes, and allow customers self-service access to those logs
                              for at least 60 days, unless otherwise noted.
                           </li>
                           <li>All providers, unless otherwise noted, offer the ability to place metadata tags on
                              provisioned resources, and to run reports based on them, which is useful for internal
                              showback or chargeback. Some providers also offer cost control measures such as quotas
                              (limits on what a user can provision) and leases (time-limited provisioning of resources).
                           </li>
                           <li>All providers offer enterprise-class support with 24/7 customer service, via phone,
                              email and chat, along with an account manager. Most providers include this with their
                              offering. Some offer a lower level of support by default, but allow customers to pay
                              extra for enterprise-class support.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers will sign contracts with customers, can invoice, and can consolidate
                              bills from multiple accounts. While some may also offer online sign-up and credit
                              card billing, they recognize that enterprise buyers prefer contracts and invoices.
                              Some will sign "zero dollar" contracts that do not commit a customer to a certain
                              volume.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the providers evaluated are believed to be financially stable, with business plans
                              that are adequately funded. Customers should not need to worry about them going out
                              of business. However, many of the smaller providers are likely to be potential acquisition
                              targets; an acquisition can cause significant changes in the strategy and direction
                              of a business, and may result in a service transition period if the merged companies
                              consolidate their platforms. Furthermore, small IaaS businesses within large vendors
                              may be subject to turmoil if the vendor changes its overall cloud strategy.
                           </li>
                           <li>Many of the providers have white-label or reseller programs, and some may be willing
                              to license their software. We mention software licensing only when it is a significant
                              portion of the provider's business; other service providers, not enterprises, are
                              usually the licensees. We do not mention channel programs; potential partners should
                              simply assume that all these companies are open to discussing a relationship. (See
                              "Infrastructure as a Service in the Cloud Services Value Chain" for details.)
                           </li>
                           <li>Most of the providers offer optional managed services on IaaS. However, not all offer
                              the same type of managed services on IaaS as they do in their broader managed hosting
                              or data center outsourcing services. Some may have managed services provider (MSP)
                              or system integrator (SI) partners that provide managed and professional services.
                           </li>
                           <li>All the evaluated providers offer a portal, documentation, technical support, customer
                              support and contracts in English. Some can provide one or more of these in languages
                              other than English. Most providers can conduct business in local languages, even if
                              all aspects of service are English-only. Customers who need multilingual support will
                              find it very challenging to source an offering.

                        <p><strong>Other notes: </strong>We list other 
capabilities of note, including important missing capabilities. We 
specifically
                           note other cloud-related services, such as 
cloud storage (which all providers have,
                           unless otherwise noted), as well as the 
availability of managed services, even though
                           those service offerings are not specifically 
evaluated in the context of this Magic
                           Quadrant, because they are capabilities 
frequently requested by customers in conjunction
                           with cloud IaaS. (See "Market Insight: 
Customers Need Hybrid Cloud Compute Infrastructure as a Service" for 
details.)
                        </p>
                        <p>In the compute notes, we state the basis of each provider's virtualization technology
                           and, if relevant, its cloud management platform (CMP). We also state what APIs it
                           supports — the Amazon Web Services (AWS), OpenStack and vCloud APIs are the three
                           that have broad adoption, but many providers also have their own unique API. Note
                           that supporting one of the three common APIs does not provide assurance that a provider's
                           service is compatible with a specific tool that purports to support that API; the
                           completeness and accuracy of API implementations vary considerably. Furthermore, neither
                           the use of the same underlying CMP nor API compatibility indicates that two services
                           are interoperable. Specifically, OpenStack-based clouds differ significantly from
                           one another, limiting portability; the marketing hype of "no vendor lock-in" is, practically
                           speaking, untrue.
                        </p>
                        <p>For many customers, the underlying hypervisor will matter, particularly for those
                           that intend to run commercial software on IaaS. Many ISVs support only VMware virtualization,
                           and those vendors that support Xen may support only Citrix XenServer, not open-source
                           Xen (which is often customized by IaaS providers and is likely to be different from
                           the current open-source version).
                        </p>
                        <p>Services that use VMware's virtualization technologies are labeled as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li><em>vCloud Datacenter Service.</em> This service has been certified to meet VMware's globally consistent service definitions,
                              security and regulatory compliance requirements, and requirements for availability
                              and high performance. It is based on a prescriptive architecture intended to maximize
                              portability between providers of vCloud Datacenter Service and a business's own VMware-virtualized
                              data center infrastructure. Only 10 providers worldwide have such a service and most
                              of them do not yet have a significant customer base on this platform. These providers
                              also meet the requirements for being vCloud Powered.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>vCloud Powered.</em> These providers are part of VMware's service provider partner program. The service
                              is based on VMware's vSphere and vCloud Director (vCD), exposes the vCloud API, and
                              supports the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) for image upload and download. Unless
                              otherwise stated, these providers expose the vCD UI to customers. Because the vCD
                              features exposed can be customized by the service provider, and the service provider
                              typically needs to provide an array of features not included in vCD (such as monitoring),
                              there is still significant differentiation between vCloud Powered providers. In a
                              vCloud Powered offering with the vCD UI exposed, vCD is used to drive self-service
                              management and provide a service catalog. vCD is a key part of VMware's strategy for
                              driving adoption of hybrid internal-external cloud IaaS, and facilitates interoperability
                              between VMware-virtualized infrastructures, regardless of whether they are internal
                              to a business or offered by a service provider. vCD provides the capability to manage
                              very complex infrastructure needs, but also requires a greater investment in training
                              and setup time from an IT administrator in order to facilitate easier self-service
                              for users.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>vCloud Express.</em> vCloud Express is a VMware-defined offering aimed at developers and small businesses,
                              with online sign-up, credit card payment, self-service and by-the-hour service.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>VMware-virtualized.</em> This service uses VMware's hypervisor, but is not a vCloud Datacenter, vCloud Powered
                              or vCloud Express service. Many such offerings are high-quality services from early,
                              market-leading innovators; these providers typically entered the market before vCD
                              became available and have elected to continue to develop their own technology.

                        </h4>
                        <p>For each vendor, we also provide recommendations for use. The most typical recommended
                           uses are:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li><em>Cloud-native applications.</em> These are applications specifically architected to run in a cloud IaaS environment,
                              using cloud transaction processing (TP) principles.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>E-business hosting.</em> These are e-marketing sites, e-commerce sites, SaaS applications, and similar modern
                              websites and Web-based applications. They are usually Internet-facing. They are designed
                              to scale out and are resilient to infrastructure failure, but they might not use cloud
                              TP principles.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>General business applications.</em> These are the kinds of general-purpose workloads typically found in the internal
                              data centers of most traditional businesses; the application users are usually located
                              within the business. Many such workloads are small, and they are often not designed
                              to scale out. They are usually architected with the assumption that the underlying
                              infrastructure is reliable, but they are not necessarily mission-critical. Examples
                              include intranet sites, collaboration applications such as Microsoft SharePoint, and
                              many business process applications.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Enterprise applications. </em>These are general-purpose workloads that are mission-critical, and they may be complex,
                              performance-sensitive or contain highly sensitive data; they are typical of a modest
                              percentage of the workloads found in the internal data centers of most traditional
                              businesses. They are usually not designed to scale out, and the workloads may demand
                              large VM sizes. They are architected with the assumption that the underlying infrastructure
                              is reliable and capable of high performance.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Development environments.</em> These workloads are related to the development and testing of applications. They
                              are assumed not to require high availability or high performance. However, they are
                              likely to require governance for teams of users.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Batch computing.</em> These workloads include high-performance computing (HPC), "big data" analytics and
                              other workloads that require large amounts of capacity on demand. They do not require
                              high availability, but may require high performance.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For all the vendors, the recommended uses are specific to self-managed cloud IaaS.
                           However, many of the providers also have managed services, as well as other cloud
                           and noncloud services that may be used in conjunction with cloud IaaS. These include
                           hybrid hosting (customers sometimes blend solutions, such as an entirely self-managed
                           front-end Web tier on public cloud IaaS, with managed hosting for the application
                           servers and database), as well as hybrid IaaS-PaaS solutions. Even though we do not
                           evaluate managed services, PaaS and the like in this Magic Quadrant, they are part
                           of a vendor's overall value proposition and we mention them in the context of providing
                           more comprehensive solution recommendations.

                        <p>AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, is a cloud-focused service provider with a very pure
                           vision of highly automated, cost-effective IT capabilities, delivered in a flexible,
                           on-demand manner.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations: </strong>AWS has groups of data centers, which it calls "regions," on the East and West Coasts
                           of the U.S., and in Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Brazil, and (in preview)
                           China. It also has one region dedicated to the U.S. federal government. It has global
                           sales. Support is provided in English, Japanese and Portuguese. Technical account
                           managers can also provide support in German, Spanish, Hindi, Korean and Mandarin.
                           The portal and documentation are available in English, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese,
                           Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Mandarin.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers multitenant, fixed-size and nonresizable, Xen-virtualized
                           VMs without autorestart. Single-tenant VMs are available via Dedicated Instances.
                           There are special options for HPC, including graphics processing units (GPUs). AWS
                           does not have any formal private cloud offerings, though it is willing to negotiate
                           such deals (such as its deal for the U.S. intelligence community cloud).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>VM storage is ephemeral. Persistence requires VM-independent block storage (Elastic
                           Block Store). There is an option for SSDs, as well as storage performance guarantees
                           (Provisioned IOPS). Object-based storage (Simple Storage Service [S3]) is integrated
                           with a CDN (CloudFront), there is an option for long-term archive storage (Glacier),
                           and AWS offers its own cloud storage gateway appliance.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Network: </strong>AWS offers a full range of networking options. Complex networking and IPsec VPN is
                           done via Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Third-party connectivity is via partner
                           exchanges (AWS Direct Connect).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Security: </strong>RBAC is per-element, with customer-defined roles and exceptional control over permissions.
                           AWS has obtained many security and compliance-related certifications and audits.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Other notes: </strong>Enterprise-grade
 support is extra. The SLA is multi-fault-domain, but does not have
                           any exclusion for maintenance; AWS also 
offers continuous availability on its portal
                           and API. Notable capabilities include 
orchestration (CloudFormation and OpsWorks),
                           autoscaling, database as a service 
(Relational Database Service [RDS]), Hadoop as
                           a service (Elastic MapReduce), data 
warehousing as a service (Redshift), and desktop
                           as a service (WorkSpaces). AWS does not offer
 colocation; a partner exchange must
                           be used instead. We provide purchasing 
guidance in "What Managers Need to Know About Amazon Web Services" and a

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Recommended uses:</strong> All use cases that run well in a virtualized environment, although highly secure
                           applications, strictly compliant or enterprise applications (especially complex ones
                           such as SAP business applications) require special attention to architecture.

                              licensed and packaged their software to run on EC2, either independently or via the
                              AWS Marketplace, which eases deployment and eliminates some of the challenges associated
                              with licensing software to run in the cloud. Its API is supported by many third parties
                              that provide associated management tools, and many open-source and commercial CMPs
                              are compatible with its API. Although AWS is not directly involved in the hybrid on-premises
                              cloud business, it has partners that can offer such solutions.
                           </li>
                           <li>AWS has an extensive network of partners that can offer assistance with adopting its
                              platform. It is increasingly targeting mainstream enterprises and the midmarket via
                              go-to-market partnerships with SIs (such as Capgemini, Cognizant and Wipro) that provide
                              application development expertise, managed services and professional services such
                              as data center migration, although such providers do not necessarily deliver solutions
                              that are optimal for the cloud environment. There are also many consulting and managed
                              services partners that offer a cloud-native approach, such as Datapipe and 2nd Watch.
                           </li>
                           <li>AWS has multiple "availability zones" (AZs) within its regions. These AZs are effectively
                              multiple data centers in close proximity to one another. AWS's services are designed
                              to make it easier to run applications across multiple AZs; customers are responsible
                              for architecting their applications for high availability. However, new capabilities
                              are rolled out incrementally, region by region, so newer capabilities are not necessarily
                              available in every region.
                           </li>

                        </h5>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>AWS is a price leader, but it charges separately for optional items that are sometimes
                              bundled with competitive offerings. This increases the complexity of understanding
                              and auditing bills. Prospective customers should be careful to model the costs accurately,
                              especially for network-related charges, and to compare the costs of reserved and unreserved
                              capacity, as well as AWS's "spot pricing" market.
                           </li>
                           <li>AWS's support offerings are tiered based on the level of support that a customer purchases,
                              rather than on a "relationship" or size-of-spend basis; the quality of support differs
                              materially between tiers. AWS does not include enterprise-grade support by default;
                              customers will need to buy Business tier support for this. Its Enterprise tier support
                              offers a dedicated technical account manager and other "platinum" capabilities, providing
                              a higher degree of support than most of its competitors offer without managed services,
                              but it carries up to a 10% premium on the customer's overall AWS spend.
                           </li>
                           <li>AWS has field sales, solutions engineering and professional services organizations,
                              but the rapid growth of AWS's business means that sales capacity is insufficient to
                              consistently satisfy prospective customers who need consultative sales. For better
                              terms and conditions, customers should sign an Enterprise Agreement, which is typically
                              a zero-dollar contract. Invoicing is available on request.
                           </li>
                           <li>AWS is beginning to face significant competition — from Microsoft in the traditional
                              business market, and from Google in the cloud-native market. So far, it has responded
                              aggressively to price drops by competitors on commodity resources. However, although
                              it is continuously reducing its prices, it does not commodity-price services where
                              it has superior capabilities. AWS currently has a multiyear competitive advantage,
                              but is no longer the only fast-moving, innovative, global-class provider in the market.

                        <h4 id="h-d2e418">CenturyLink</h4>
                        <p>CenturyLink acquired Savvis, a Web hoster with a long track record of leadership in
                           the hosting market, in 2011. It acquired Tier 3, a pure-play cloud IaaS provider,
                           in November 2013, and merged it into Savvis to create the CenturyLink Technology Solutions
                           business unit. It has a broad suite of offerings, including colocation, managed hosting,
                           data center outsourcing, and PaaS (via its acquisition of AppFog). Its public cloud
                           IaaS offering, CenturyLink Cloud, uses the newly acquired Tier 3 platform. The former
                           Savvis public and private cloud IaaS offerings, which were under the Symphony brand,
                           and are now known as Cloud Data Center and Cloud Servers, are no longer being actively
                           marketed to new customers, although CenturyLink will still provide these solutions
                           if appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations: </strong>CenturyLink Cloud (CLC) is available in multiple data centers across the U.S., along
                           with Canada, Germany and the U.K. CenturyLink's private cloud offerings are available
                           in a broad range of data centers globally. CenturyLink has global sales, and business
                           is conducted in local languages, but the service is offered only in English.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>CLC is a multitenant, paid-by-the-VM, VMware-virtualized offering. The legacy Cloud
                           Data Center 2 service (CDC2, the successor to Savvis Symphony VPDC) is a multitenant,
                           paid-by-the-VM, VMware-virtualized offering. The Cloud Servers service (originally
                           offered under the Symphony Open and Dedicated brands) is VMware-virtualized, with
                           varying pricing models, and does not have an API. All offerings lack simultaneous
                           provisioning.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>CLC has persistent local storage with an SSD option, as well as VM-independent block
                           storage that is integrated with rolling backups and disaster recovery options. The
                           other offerings only have local storage.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Network: </strong>There is no back-end load balancing. None of the offerings support the ability to
                           use customer-supplied IP addresses, nor do they fully support self-service complex
                           network topologies. Most of the CLC data centers are not yet privately connected via
                           the CenturyLink network.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Security: </strong>CLC's RBAC is per element. CDC2's RBAC is per group. CLC does not support MFA. CLC
                           can support PCI requirements, but other compliance requirements require noncloud elements
                           or managed services.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Other notes: </strong>CLC's Blueprints can be used to script the provisioning of complex, multi-data-center
                           infrastructure configurations. CLC supports leases. Managed services for the guest
                           OS layer are optional in CLC and CDC2. The full range of managed services are available
                           in CenturyLink's private cloud IaaS offerings. CenturyLink also offers database as
                           a service.

                           <li>CenturyLink has a compelling and distinctive vision of application-fluent infrastructure
                              that spans network, compute and storage capabilities. With the acquisition of Tier
                              3, it has obtained an IaaS offering that combines an excellent, differentiated set
                              of features on a well-engineered platform with an easy-to-use self-service portal.
                              It is one of the few services with both cloud-native capabilities that are attractive
                              to developers and the governance and management features needed by large enterprises.
                           </li>
                           <li>CenturyLink has a well-established track record of delivering enterprise cloud services
                              for production and mission-critical needs, including addressing the needs of customers
                              with extensive security and compliance requirements. However, many of CenturyLink's
                              capabilities are delivered as managed services, rather than true cloud services.
                           </li>
                           <li>While CenturyLink is increasingly focused on using the cloud as a means to enter the
                              data center outsourcing market, it nevertheless has a competitive feature set for
                              self-service, and successfully blends the self-service and managed services models
                              across a hybrid solution portfolio. The existing CenturyLink base of managed hosting,
                              colocation and network customers provides it with cross-selling opportunities.

                              the resources and agility of the leading providers in this market. CenturyLink will
                              need to focus on midmarket and enterprise customers who need tailored solutions and
                              managed services.
                           </li>
                           <li>CenturyLink is consolidating all of its IaaS platforms. Previously, it had multiple
                              types of single-tenant and multitenant IaaS. This means that existing customers will
                              eventually have to migrate to the new CLC offering; the older offerings are still
                              being supported but no longer being improved. However, CLC is currently only multitenant,
                              so CenturyLink continues to sell its previous single-tenant offerings, and in some
                              cases, may also sell its other legacy offerings. Current and prospective customers
                              who do not intend to use CLC should consider what they will do over the long term.

                           <li>CenturyLink is still learning to deliver solutions on the CLC offering, which creates
                              challenges for sales, solution engineering, installation and delivery. Customers who
                              are not simply using self-service on the standard multitenant CLC offering should
                              take extra care to understand how CenturyLink intends to architect and deliver their
                              solution. Furthermore, over the past two years, Savvis customers have reported customer
                              service challenges.

                           It has global sales. Support is provided in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish
                           and Mandarin. The portal and documentation are available only in English.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>CSC offers a vCloud Datacenter Service, a VCE Vblock-based cloud IaaS architecture
                           in different tenancy models — public multitenant in a CSC data center (CloudCompute),
                           single-tenant compute with a multitenant back-end (BizCloud Virtual Private Edition
                           [VPE]), and private single-tenant in a CSC data center or in the customer's own data
                           center (BizCloud) — and optional managed services. It offers both paid-by-the-VM and
                           SRP pricing, but requires annual contracts. Because features are introduced into BizCloud
                           before being rolled into CloudCompute, the latter contains a subset of BizCloud features;
                           furthermore, it lacks autorestart. While customers can access vCloud Director if they
                           prefer, CSC has built its own, more user-friendly portal.

                              offers CA LISA Release Automation (formerly Nolio) as part of its platform. Its November
                              2013 acquisition of ServiceMesh has brought significant additional capabilities, including
                              multicloud management. It is also building infrastructure utility services for specific
                              applications on top of the platform.

                           <li>CSC is one of the few providers to have a standardized architecture across both public
                              and private cloud offerings, as well as a single rate card across all these offerings
                              — although the pricing is the same, the minimum commitments vary. CSC's pricing for
                              infrastructure resources is very competitive.

                           <li>Since acquiring ServiceMesh, CSC has reduced its focus on developing its own cloud
                              IaaS offering, in favor of becoming a cloud services brokerage that can capably manage
                              multiple clouds, including AWS and Microsoft Azure. CSC now leads sales with ServiceMesh's
                              Agility Platform capabilities, and then helps the customer choose the appropriate
                              IaaS offering, which might or might not be CSC's own. This may impact CSC's willingness
                              to invest in its own cloud IaaS platform.
                           </li>
                           <li>Cloud computing is driving a radical reinvention of the way in which CSC delivers
                              services, including significantly broadening the range of companies that CSC targets
                              with its offerings. The cloud division is run as its own business unit, which gives
                              it greater agility but also sometimes brings it into conflict with its slower-moving
                              and more conservative parent company. At present, however, CSC is investing heavily
                              in its cloud business.
                           </li>
                           <li>Prospective CSC customers should be careful to understand the distinction between
                              CSC's outsourcing business and its cloud offerings; in particular, they should be
                              sure to understand what is and isn't within the scope of a particular tier of managed
                              services. Existing CSC outsourcing customers report challenges in getting CSC to engage
                              in cloud opportunities.
                           </li>
                           <li>CSC's focus has been on enabling traditional IT operations organizations to make the
                              transition to cloud infrastructure, and this remains true as it expands to managing
                              multiple cloud IaaS offerings. CSC is trying to increase its traction with developer
                              audiences, but will find this challenging, given the positioning of the broader CSC
                              brand.

                           <li>Although Dimension Data has a capable basic cloud IaaS offering, it needs value-added

                              It has tried to differentiate based on its network model, but such capabilities are

                              has enabled certain regions, such as Australia, to develop offerings tailored to the
                              needs of their local markets, at a faster pace than Fujitsu has been able to do so
                              as a global entity. Fujitsu has begun an "offering standardization process" intended
                              to bring the regional offerings in line with the global ones, but it may be a few
                              years before this is accomplished.

                              or projects targeted at the Japanese market should investigate what capabilities are

                           <li>Fujitsu's previous strategy of allowing regional control means that development efforts
                              have been fragmented across the globe. As such, the private hosted service offerings
                              may differ in each region, making it difficult for Fujitsu to capitalize fully on
                              engineering resources and achieve economies of scale, although Fujitsu has recently
                              strengthened its global cloud strategy and management.

                        <p>Google is an Internet-centric provider of technology and services. Google Cloud Platform
                           combines an IaaS offering (Google Compute Engine [GCE]), an application PaaS offering
                           (Google App Engine) and a range of complementary services. Google has been operating
                           App Engine since 2008, but did not enter the IaaS market until the general-availability
                           launch of GCE in December 2013.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations:</strong> Google groups its GCE data centers into "regions," each of which contains at least
                           two availability zones. There is a central U.S. region, a European region (located
                           in Belgium), and an Asia region (located in Taiwan). It has global sales. Support
                           is available in English and Japanese. The portal is available in English, Spanish,
                           Portuguese, Japanese and Mandarin. Documentation is available in those languages,
                           plus French, German, Russian, Cantonese and Korean.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute:</strong> GCE offers multitenant, fixed-size and nonresizable, KVM-virtualized VMs, metered
                           by the minute. Provisioning is exceptionally fast (typically under 1 minute).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage:</strong> VM storage is persistent, and there is also VM-independent block storage. All block
                           storage is encrypted.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Network: </strong>Third-party private connectivity is not supported. Customers cannot bring their own
                           private IP addresses (although this need may possibly be addressed by GCE's Advanced
                           Routing features). There is no back-end load balancing.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Security:</strong> RBAC permissions apply to the whole account.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Other notes:</strong> Enterprise-grade support is extra. The SLA is multi-fault-domain, and excludes maintenance
                           in Europe (where Transparent Maintenance is not available yet). Google cannot address
                           the need for colocated equipment. Autoscaling capabilities (Replica Pools) are in

                           <li>Google's strategy for Google Cloud Platform centers on the concept of allowing other
                              organizations to "run like Google" by taking Google's highly innovative internal technology
                              capabilities and exposing them as services that other companies can purchase. Consequently,
                              although Google is a late entrant to the IaaS market, it is primarily productizing
                              existing capabilities, rather than having to engineer those capabilities from scratch.
                              It will therefore be able to advance its offering more rapidly than most competitors.
                           </li>
                           <li>Google has a comprehensive vision for, and extensive experience with, how cloud-native
                              applications are developed and managed through the life cycle. It has a fluid notion
                              of the boundaries between IaaS and PaaS that will, over time, enable customers to
                              choose their trade-offs between control and automated management.
                           </li>
                           <li>Google, as an overall corporate entity, has a very broad global data center footprint,
                              an enormous amount of existing infrastructure capacity, and its own high-capacity
                              global network. It is extremely efficient at operations. GCE represents little incremental
                              cost to Google, which means it can price aggressively and emphasize the value of high
                              performance for the money. Over time, though, Google will differentiate itself with
                              platform and manageability features, not prices.

                              Its feature set is nascent. However, Google's road map is innovative and aggressive,
                              and it is rapidly introducing new capabilities. Its short-term focus is on better
                              enabling new cloud-native applications, with less attention being paid to capabilities
                              needed for other workloads. It has no hybrid cloud strategy.
                           </li>
                           <li>Although Google has significant appeal to technology-centric businesses, it is still
                              learning to engage with enterprise and midmarket customers, and needs to expand its
                              sales, solutions engineering and support capabilities. Furthermore, Google needs to
                              earn the trust of businesses. Google also lacks many capabilities important to businesses
                              that want to migrate legacy workloads to the cloud.
                           </li>
                           <li>Google needs to build an ecosystem around GCE (and, more broadly, Google Cloud Platform),
                              and its partner program is nascent. However, Google is perceived as a likely future
                              market leader, and cloud management tool vendors and other software companies, along
                              with system integrators, are rapidly adding support for GCE.

                           a focus on SMBs, and in January 2014, shut down its own SmartCloud Enterprise cloud
                           IaaS offering, after migrating its existing customers to SoftLayer. IBM's related
                           non-IaaS portfolio includes IBM Cloud Managed Services (cloud-enabled managed services,
                           formerly called SmartCloud Enterprise+), as well as Codename: BlueMix (a Cloud Foundry-based
                           PaaS, currently in beta).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations: </strong>SoftLayer has multiple data centers in the U.S., along with data centers in the Netherlands
                           and Singapore. It has global sales. It offers support in English, Dutch, German, and
                           Spanish. The portal and documentation are available in English only.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute:</strong> SoftLayer's cloud IaaS offering was formerly known as CloudLayer, but SoftLayer has
                           stopped distinguishing this offering from its dedicated hosting options. SoftLayer's
                           IaaS is paid-by-the-VM, Citrix-Xen-virtualized, and available as a single-tenant or
                           multitenant offering. There is an option for single-tenant VMs within SoftLayer's
                           multitenant public cloud. There is also an option for "bare metal" (nonvirtualized)
                           servers, by the hour.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>Storage is persistent and VM-independent block storage is available. There is OpenStack
                           object-based storage with an integrated CDN (via a partnership with Internap).
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Network: </strong>SoftLayer supports a full range of networking options.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Security: </strong>SoftLayer supports only grouping, not full metadata tagging, and RBAC permissions
                           are per-group.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Other notes: </strong>SoftLayer has an extensive dedicated server business, although these bare-metal custom
                           configurations require monthly commitments. Managed services are available through
                           IBM. There is no support for colocation.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Recommended uses:</strong> E-business hosting, general business applications, large-scale use cases such as
                           gaming where bare metal is desirable, and infrastructure for IBM outsourcing deals.

                           <li>IBM's cloud vision encompasses public and private clouds at both the system and application
                              infrastructure levels. IBM's portfolio of products and services has IaaS, PaaS and
                              SaaS elements, along with hardware, ITOM software, middleware and database software,
                              and comprehensive consulting and outsourcing capabilities. SoftLayer will be the common
                              hosting platform for IBM's services in the future.
                           </li>
                           <li>IBM has a strong vision for how the shift to cloud will radically transform its business
                              over time, including altering its go-to-market strategy, with an increasing focus
                              on online sign-up and self-service. SoftLayer is one of its first forays into self-service
                              and serving SMB customers. IBM has a strong brand and existing customer relationships
                              across the globe, and its base of strategic outsourcing customers will help drive
                              a cloud-enabled data center outsourcing business on top of SoftLayer.
                           </li>
                           <li>IBM intends to make local presence one of its competitive differentiators, taking
                              advantage of SoftLayer's relatively small-scale "pod" architecture to expand the service
                              from three countries to 15, over the course of 2014. However, in the near future,
                              IBM will continue to be a hosting-scale provider, which may make it difficult for
                              it to match the cost economics of the hyperscale market leaders.
                           </li>
                           <li>SoftLayer has a particularly clean service composition, with a range of options that
                              can be added on a per-instance, paid-by-the-hour basis, including aspects such as
                              the type of monitoring and the automated response to a failure detected by monitoring.
                              Instances can be VMs or dedicated servers, and SoftLayer emphasizes that bare-metal
                              physical servers can be managed with the same elasticity as VMs, and that single-tenant
                              and multitenant infrastructure can be seamlessly mixed within the same solution.
                           </li>

                        </h5>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>Although IBM has set out a broad vision for cloud services, it lacks integrated IaaS
                              and PaaS capabilities; IBM's PaaS (Codename: BlueMix) is simply hosted on SoftLayer.
                              It has not articulated a vision for how SoftLayer itself will be differentiated, beyond
                              the availability of bare-metal servers and future in-country presence. We believe
                              it is more likely that customers who pursue strategic adoption of IBM cloud services
                              will do so for the managed services and other higher-level capabilities, than for
                              the core SoftLayer capabilities.
                           </li>
                           <li>SoftLayer has historically been strongly focused on self-service for SMB customers.
                              The acquisition by IBM has brought enterprise sales capabilities, including channel
                              capabilities, to the SoftLayer business, as well as the higher-level IBM managed services.
                              However, customers report that SoftLayer services still feel like a small-business
                              experience, not an enterprise experience, particularly with regard to the portal,
                              sales and support. We recommend that customers engage with SoftLayer through an IBM
                              sales channel, rather than through SoftLayer's own direct sales mechanisms.
                           </li>
                           <li>IBM is "cloudwashing" SoftLayer's dedicated server business, applying a "cloud IaaS"
                              label to what is actually simply dedicated hosting. While SoftLayer has significant
                              automation, as well as a customer-accessible API, for this portion of its business,
                              customers should be sure to understand the technical and business differences between
                              SoftLayer's dedicated hosting (customized bare-metal servers by the month) and cloud
                              IaaS (fully automated, by-the-hour compute in the form of VMs or bare metal).
                           </li>
                           <li>Although IBM has an OpenStack-based strategy for its private cloud business, SoftLayer's
                              compute infrastructure is not OpenStack-based. Customers who want OpenStack or other
                              CMPs on SoftLayer must obtain them as custom, hosted, managed services. SoftLayer
                              has a proprietary API that has not yet gained widespread third-party tool support,
                              although IBM is working to build the necessary ecosystem, and has also begun a project
                              called Jumpgate, to provide an OpenStack-to-SoftLayer API translation gateway.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>Joyent offers fixed-size, paid-by-the-VM public cloud IaaS (SmartMachines), and private
                           cloud services in a variety of pricing models. The host OS is Joyent's own SmartOS,
                           an open-source derivative of OpenSolaris, managed by the illumos community. Customers
                           have a choice between OS virtualization in a SmartOS Container and KVM virtualization
                           on a SmartOS Container for Linux and Windows guests.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>VM storage is persistent, but there is no VM-independent block storage. There is an
                           SSD option. Joyent's S3-compatible object-based cloud storage (Manta) has a unique
                           architecture designed for batch jobs that require high-performance access to large
                           amounts of storage, with an in-place batch compute service separate from Joyent's
                           main compute service.

                           <li>Microsoft has a vision of infrastructure and platform services that are not only leading
                              stand-alone offerings, but that also seamlessly extend and interoperate with on-premises
                              Microsoft infrastructure (rooted in Hyper-V, Windows Server, Active Directory and
                              System Center) and applications, as well as Microsoft's SaaS offerings. Its vision
                              is global, and it is aggressively expanding into multiple international markets.
                           </li>
                           <li>Microsoft's brand, existing customer relationships, history of running global-class
                              consumer Internet properties, deep investments in engineering, and aggressive road
                              map have enabled it rapidly to attain the status of strategic cloud IaaS provider.
                              It is second in terms of cloud IaaS market share — albeit a distant second — but far
                              ahead of its smaller competitors. Microsoft has pledged to maintain AWS-comparable
                              pricing for the general public, and Microsoft customers who sign a contract can receive
                              their enterprise discount on the service, making it highly cost-competitive. Microsoft
                              is also extending special pricing to Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscribers.
                           </li>
                           <li>The broader Microsoft Azure service is a full-featured PaaS offering with significant
                              complementary capabilities; the Virtual Machines are integrated into the overall offering.
                              The IaaS and PaaS components within Microsoft Azure feel and operate like part of
                              a unified whole, and Microsoft is making an effort to integrate them with Visual Studio,
                              Team Foundation Server, Active Directory, System Center and PowerShell. Conversely,
                              Windows Azure Pack offers an Azure-like user experience for on-premises infrastructure.
                              Microsoft has built an attractive, modern, easy-to-use UI that will appeal to Windows
                              administrators and developers. The integration with existing Microsoft tools is particularly
                              attractive to customers who want hybrid cloud solutions.

                           <li>Azure Infrastructure Services are relatively new. Although Microsoft rolled out an
                              array of new features throughout 2013, and continues rapidly to release both "catch-up"
                              capabilities and fresh innovations, many enterprises will still find significant capability
                              gaps, especially in networking and security. Many features are in "preview" (beta)
                              or "coming soon," and it is not always obvious to customers which features are still
                              in preview. Customers who intend to adopt Azure strategically and migrate applications
                              over a period of two years or more (finishing in 2016 or later) can begin to deploy
                              some workloads now, but those with a broad range of immediate enterprise needs are
                              likely to encounter challenges.
                           </li>
                           <li>Microsoft is in the midst of a multiyear initiative to make its on-premises software
                              "cloud first," rather than trying to scale software originally built for on-premises
                              single-enterprise use. It now faces the challenges of getting its core infrastructure
                              technology to operate at cloud scale, managing that infrastructure at cloud scale,
                              and facilitating the ability of customers to move toward more highly automated infrastructure.
                           </li>
                           <li>Microsoft has just begun to build an ecosystem of partners around Azure Infrastructure
                              Services, and it does not yet have a software licensing marketplace. Furthermore,
                              it has little in the way of enterprise Linux options. Consequently, the offering is
                              currently very Microsoft-centric and appeals primarily to .NET developers, although
                              customers do run heterogeneous environments in Azure.

                              record in the market for VMware-virtualized enterprise-class public cloud IaaS. It
                              can address hybrid hosting use cases via ECME, which bundles in managed services but
                              has fewer self-service capabilities. However, Verizon Terremark's competitive differentiators
                              have eroded over time as competitors have caught up and, in some cases, surpassed
                              it in feature development.

                           <li>Verizon Terremark introduced the beta of a next-generation, unified platform, called
                              Verizon Cloud, in late 2013. This new platform will enable it to address a much broader
                              range of use cases, and consolidates its development efforts onto a single hypervisor-neutral
                              platform. However, although the Verizon Cloud has an innovative architecture, it needs
                              to deliver more than a capable cloud IaaS platform and associated network services
                              in order to realize its cloud ambitions.
                           </li>
                           <li>Verizon Terremark has begun to build an ecosystem around Verizon Cloud, primarily
                              with ISVs and hardware vendors whose technology can be delivered as a virtual appliance.
                              However, it does not have a software marketplace.

                           <li>Until Verizon Terremark launches its new unified platform, customers must be careful
                              to match the service they choose to their particular use case. They should also be
                              aware that while Verizon Terremark is continuing to enhance existing cloud offerings,
                              its engineering focus has shifted to the new platform.

                              its future success on rapid innovation driven by agile development. This is an unusual
                              strategy for a company owned by a telecom carrier, and it is highly dependent on Verizon's
                              willingness to interfere minimally with management. It is also competing with providers
                              that have much greater engineering resources and a much faster pace of innovation.

                              the people who control network procurement. Verizon needs to become relevant to business
                              managers and application development leaders, in order for Verizon Terremark to achieve
                              its potential.

                           In addition to its cloud IaaS offering, it sells the software for its platform, which
                           is called xStream.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations: </strong>Virtustream has data centers in the eastern and western U.S., and in the U.K. and
                           Netherlands. It has sales in the U.S., along with London and Dubai sales offices.
                           The service is provided in English only.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>xStream is hypervisor-neutral but typically supports VMware and KVM. It is offered
                           in both single-tenant and multitenant variants; it can support single-tenant VMs in
                           its public cloud, as well as bare metal. VMs are available by the hour, bare metal
                           is available by the month, and both paid-by-the-VM and SRP models are available.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>Block storage is VM-independent, with SSD and encryption options. While storage snapshots
                           are supported, they cannot be used as VM images. There is no object-based storage.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Network: </strong>Virtustream supports a full range of networking options, although it does not have

                        <p><strong>Security: </strong>RBAC is per-element and very configurable. Virtustream embeds a tool for governance,
                           risk management and compliance (GRC). In February 2014, Virtustream acquired ViewTrust
                           Technology, and it is integrating this company's capabilities as a service.

                              from SAP America. Its cloud is targeted primarily at production applications, but,
                              in an unusual approach, it is targeting both traditional enterprise workloads, including
                              ERP applications, and cloud-native applications. It has been successful at winning
                              large-scale enterprise deals, particularly those focused on SAP and that require managed

                              much of its infrastructure is VMware-virtualized, it can also support other hypervisors.
                              It has divided its portal into an administrative UI and an end-user UI, to address

                           It entered the cloud IaaS market when it launched the VMware vCloud Hybrid Service
                           (vCHS) into general availability in September 2013. It is a subsidiary of EMC.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Locations: </strong>vCHS is available in multiple data centers in the U.S., as well as in the U.K. VMware
                           has global sales. Support is available in English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish,
                           Hindi, Japanese, and Mandarin. The portal and documentation are available in English
                           only.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Compute: </strong>vCHS is a public cloud IaaS offering available in two variants, Virtual Private Cloud
                           (multitenant compute and storage) and Dedicated Cloud (single-tenant compute and multitenant
                           storage). It most closely resembles a vCloud Datacenter Service. Both offerings use
                           SRP pricing; only Dedicated Cloud allows the customer to oversubscribe the resources.
                        </p>

                              committed to its technologies. Its strategy for vCHS is to offer hybrid cloud options
                              to existing VMware customers, reinforcing its position in internal data centers, and
                              expanding its total addressable market. It wants to offer customers a consistent experience
                              across VMware-based infrastructure, whether delivered as an on-premises virtualized

                              vCHS first. However, VMware lacks service operations experience and vCHS lacks an
                              operational track record; VMware might find it challenging to scale the service. Furthermore,

                              who are typically the key decision makers for cloud IaaS sourcing. VMware administrators
                              in IT operations are the most likely champions of vCHS within a business, but they
                              often prefer to build an internal private cloud, and they are also often the people
                              that the business is trying to bypass by going to cloud IaaS. VMware needs to win
                              over these administrators with regard to vCHS, but it also needs to develop a compelling
                              value proposition for developers. Although EMC also owns Pivotal, and Cloud Foundry-based
                              PaaS can be hosted on vCHS, VMware is also in the process of independently building
                              developer-oriented capabilities.
                           </li>
                           <li>VMware has previously used service providers as its channel to market, but none of
                              those service providers attained true scale and they were not able to maintain the
                              level of innovation necessary in this market. VMware is now directly competing with
                              this channel, but it faces the same technical challenges, and many of the same business
                              challenges, as those service providers. vCHS is a new offering, and has not yet established
                              an operational track record.
                           </li>
                           <li>VMware needs to build an ecosystem around vCHS. It has launched a software marketplace,
                              but the software available via the vCHS service catalog currently only includes operating
                              systems and Microsoft SQL Server. VMware does have a strong channel in its broader
                              business, but SIs, MSPs and value-added resellers need to learn to sell vCHS effectively
                              and deliver value on top.

                        <p>This Magic Quadrant is global in scope, but most of the providers are based in the
                           U.S. This is a reflection of the way the market is evolving. The market has matured
                           more quickly in the U.S. and the bulk of revenue comes from U.S.-based customers and
                           flows to U.S.-based companies — U.S.-based IaaS providers typically derive 20% or
                           more of their revenue from customers outside the U.S. However, all the providers in
                           this Magic Quadrant offer their services on a global basis, and most have at least
                           one data center in North America, Western Europe and Asia/Pacific.
                        </p>
                        <p>Significant Europe-based providers not in this Magic Quadrant include arsys, CloudSigma,
                           Colt, Gigas, Orange Business Services, OVH and Skyscape. Providers with significant
                           presence in the Asia/Pacific region that are not in this Magic Quadrant include Datapipe,
                           NTT and Tata Communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the evaluations for this Magic Quadrant, we considered a variety of interesting
                           cloud IaaS providers that did not meet the criteria for inclusion. The more distinctive
                           ones, by use case, include:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li><strong>Development: </strong>Skytap, which has deep self-service "lab management" capabilities and features that
                              support collaboration between developers, using either its own infrastructure or AWS.
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>Disaster Recovery: </strong>Hosting and iland, which offer disaster recovery as a service on their cloud IaaS
                              platforms.
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>Enterprise applications: </strong>NaviSite, a Time Warner Cable Company, whose cloud IaaS platform is suitable for hosting
                              Oracle e-Business Suite and other complex applications.
                           </li>
                           <li><strong>HPC: </strong>CloudSigma, Peer 1 Hosting and ProfitBricks, which offer configurations and pricing
                              models that are attractive for HPC.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are also many cloud IaaS providers that specialize in serving small businesses
                           that typically use just one or two VMs; examples are DigitalOcean, ElasticHosts and
                           Linode. These low-cost providers are often used as an alternative to mass-market hosting.
                           Gartner clients typically have needs beyond what such providers can fulfill.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though some businesses may use PaaS in a
 very IaaS-like manner, we excluded PaaS
                           providers from this Magic Quadrant, with the 
exception of those PaaS providers that
                           also have a qualifying IaaS offering. PaaS 
offerings do not allow customers to obtain
                           raw VMs that can be loaded with arbitrary 
operating systems, middleware and applications,
                           which is a requirement for being considered 
as IaaS. For PaaS providers, see "Magic Quadrant for Enterprise 
Application Platform as a Service" and "Magic Quadrant for Enterprise 
Integration Platform as a Service."

                        <p>Gartner analysts evaluate technology vendors on the quality and efficacy of the processes,
                           systems, methods or procedures that enable IT providers' performance to be competitive,
                           efficient and effective, and to positively affect revenue, retention and reputation.
                           Ultimately, technology providers are judged on their ability to capitalize on their
                           vision, and on their success in doing so.
                        </p>
                        <p>We evaluated vendors' Ability to Execute in this market by using the following criteria:</p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li><em>Product/Service:</em> Service providers were evaluated on the capabilities of their cloud IaaS offering
                              to support the four use cases being evaluated. We evaluated the breadth and depth
                              of the feature set, self-service capabilities, automated system management and suitability
                              to run a broad range of workload types. This criterion is important to buyers who
                              want to purchase the most capable, feature-rich service.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Overall Viability (Business Unit, Financial, Strategy, Organization):</em> Providers were evaluated on the success of their cloud IaaS business, as demonstrated
                              by current revenue and revenue growth since the launch of their service; their financial
                              wherewithal to continue investing in the business and to execute successfully on their
                              road maps; and their organizational commitment to this business, and its importance
                              to the company's overall strategy. This criterion is important to buyers who prefer
                              to purchase services from large vendors with ample financial resources, or from vendors
                              that have a position of market leadership and are continuing to invest aggressively
                              in the business, or who are concerned about their long-term strategic investment in
                              a particular vendor.

                           <li><em>Sales Execution/Pricing:</em> Providers were evaluated on their ability to address the range of buyers for IaaS,
                              including developers and business managers, as well as IT operations organizations;
                              adapt to "frictionless selling" with online sales, immediate trials and proofs of
                              concept; provide consultative sales and solutions engineering; be highly responsive
                              to prospective customers; and offer value for money. This criterion is important to
                              buyers who value a smooth sales experience, the right solution proposals and competitive
                              prices.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Market Responsiveness and Track Record:</em> This market is evolving extremely quickly and the rate of technological innovation
                              is very high. Providers were evaluated on how well they have historically been able
                              to respond to changing buyer needs and technology developments, rapidly iterate their
                              service offerings, and deliver promised enhancements and services by the expected
                              time. This criterion is important to buyers who value rapid delivery of cutting-edge
                              capabilities.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Marketing Execution:</em> Providers were evaluated on their mind share and brand awareness in the market; their
                              ability to convey marketing messages based on their ability to deliver real business
                              value, not empty hype or misleading "cloudwashing;" and the clarity and accuracy of
                              their marketing messages, compared with their actual service offering. This criterion
                              is important to buyers who prefer to buy from well-known vendors.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Customer Experience:</em> Providers were evaluated on the quality and responsiveness of their account management
                              and technical support; the ease of use of their self-service functionality; the capabilities
                              of their customer portal (additional functionality such as monitoring, reporting and
                              trouble ticketing); the usefulness of their documentation and customer communications;
                              the quality of their SLAs; the ease of doing business with them; and overall customer
                              satisfaction. This criterion is important to buyers who value the aspects of the vendor
                              relationship and capabilities beyond the IaaS platform itself.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Operations:</em> Providers were evaluated on their ability to meet their goals and commitments, including
                              their track record of service delivery; the quality of their response to outages;
                              and their ability to meet timelines that are communicated to customers and to the
                              market. This criterion is important to buyers who want a reliable, predictable service
                              experience.
                           </li>

                        <p>Our evaluation of a service provider's Ability to Execute remains similar to that
                           of the 2012 and 2013 Magic Quadrants. We have continued to raise our expectations
                           of a provider's feature set, and we have further increased the weighting of Overall
                           Viability, reflecting our belief that even though some providers can accomplish great
                           things with relatively few resources, long-term success in this market will require
                           substantial investment, as well as the ability to attract an ecosystem.

                        <p>Gartner analysts evaluate technology vendors on their ability to articulate logical
                           statements convincingly about current and future market direction, innovation, customer
                           needs and competitive forces, as well as how they map to Gartner's position. Ultimately,
                           technology providers are assessed on their understanding of the ways in which market
                           forces can be exploited to create opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>We assessed vendors' Completeness of Vision in this market by using the following
                           criteria:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li><em>Market Understanding:</em> Providers were evaluated on their understanding of the wants and needs of three different
                              buying constituencies in this market — enterprises, midmarket businesses and technology
                              companies of all sizes — both currently and in the longer term as the use of IaaS
                              matures. This criterion is important to buyers who value a provider's understanding
                              of the market's evolution and broader business trends, which impact a provider's ability
                              to plan a successful long-term strategy.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Marketing Strategy:</em> Providers were evaluated on their ability to articulate their position in the market
                              and their competitive differentiation, and to communicate these messages clearly and
                              consistently, both internally and externally. This criterion is important to buyers
                              who believe that providers should have a clear focus and direction.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Sales Strategy:</em> Providers were evaluated on their understanding of the buying centers for the market,
                              and the way that these different buying centers want to engage with sales, as well
                              as their strategy for adapting their sales force, online channel and partner channels
                              to the IaaS market. This criterion is important to buyers who value a provider's ability
                              to grow its business over the long term.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Offering (Product) Strategy:</em> Providers were evaluated on the breadth, depth, quality and differentiation of their
                              service road maps, as relevant to the four use cases under evaluation, with an emphasis
                              on self-service, automated ITOM and overall feature set. This criterion is important
                              to buyers who want a provider who will lead the market in service capabilities.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Business Model:</em> Providers were evaluated on their overall value proposition and their strategy for
                              providing solutions for the use cases under consideration, not just raw infrastructure
                              elements. This included evaluating how IaaS fits into their broader product portfolio
                              and product strategy. This criterion is important to buyers who view IaaS as part
                              of an integrated set of solutions from a particular provider.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Vertical/Industry Strategy:</em> Providers were evaluated on their ability to offer targeted services for particular
                              vertical markets, such as government, biotechnology, media and entertainment, and
                              retail. This includes sales and marketing to such verticals, their ability to meet
                              specialized compliance needs, and vertical-specific solutions. This criterion is not
                              directly important to most buyers, except to the extent that a provider has a vertical-specific
                              offering that is relevant to them.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Innovation:</em> Providers were evaluated on the level of investment in the future of their business,
                              and the quality of those investments, whether financial or human capital; this includes
                              aspects such as the deployment of engineering resources, investments in new technology,
                              mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships and alliances. This criterion is important
                              to buyers who care about leading-edge capabilities, and the strength of a provider's
                              ecosystem.
                           </li>
                           <li><em>Geographic Strategy:</em> Providers were evaluated on their ability to expand their offering beyond their home
                              region, serving the needs of multinational businesses, as well as adapting their offerings
                              to other geographies. In particular, this included their strategy for international
                              sales and support, as well as their data center footprints and internationalization
                              efforts. This criterion is important to buyers who want to use a global vendor.
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Our evaluation of Completeness of Vision remains similar to that of the 2012 and 2013
                           Magic Quadrants. However, we have continued to increase our expectations for the breadth
                           and depth of a provider's vision. We believe that a comprehensive vision must encompass
                           the ambition to run any workload, at anytime, anywhere in the world, with the appropriate
                           availability, performance, security and isolation — including the ability to self-service
                           all of the necessary compute, storage, network and management capabilities — in cooperation
                           with an ecosystem of supporting partners.

                        <p>When people think about "cloud computing," 
cloud IaaS is often one of the first things
                           that comes to mind. It's the "computing" in 
cloud computing — on-demand compute, storage
                           and network resources, delivered on-demand, 
in near-real-time, as a service. There
                           has been tremendous hype about these 
services, but there are also a number of use
                           cases for which cloud IaaS delivers excellent
 business value. Although the market
                           is immature, it is evolving rapidly; it has 
begun its journey up the Slope of Enlightenment
                           on Gartner's "Hype Cycle for Cloud Computing,
 2013." Unfortunately, there is a great deal of market confusion and 
many providers articulate
                           their offerings poorly. Therefore, care 
should be taken when sourcing these services.
                        </p>
                        <p>The common use cases for cloud IaaS are development and testing environments; HPC
                           and batch processing; Internet-facing websites and Web-based applications (which may
                           or may not have architectures specifically designed for the cloud); and non-mission-critical
                           internal business applications. An increasing number of organizations now run mission-critical
                           business applications on cloud IaaS, and a significant number of organizations are
                           in the midst of migrating most or all of their infrastructure to cloud IaaS. Migrations
                           are most frequently done to avoid major capital expenditure, such as a hardware refresh
                           or the construction of a data center.
                        </p>
                        <p>Initially, most businesses choose use cases 
that are peripheral to their organization's
                           IT needs, but, over time, they adopt cloud 
IaaS for mainstream business applications
                           as well, including mission-critical 
applications, mirroring the past decade's adoption
                           pattern of virtualization in the data center.
 Many businesses, especially in the midmarket,
                           will eventually migrate away from running 
their own data centers in favor of relying
                           primarily on infrastructure in the cloud. 
Gartner's 2013 CIO Priorities Survey indicates
                           that 28% of CIOs expect to source all 
critical applications and operations via the
                           cloud by 2016, and 55% expect to do so by 
2020 (see "Hunting and Harvesting in a Digital World: The 2013 CIO 
Agenda").
                        </p>
                        <p>Although some organizations still source cloud IaaS in a tactical, per-project fashion,
                           most organizations are now looking for long-term strategic partners. This 2014 Magic
                           Quadrant focuses on evaluating providers through the lens of their suitability for
                           strategic adoption. We believe that while the market is still relatively immature,
                           customers may reasonably begin making strategic choices, based on their own speed
                           of adoption. Customers who will not have the majority of their workloads on cloud
                           IaaS until 2016 or later may choose strategic providers whose offerings are still
                           substantively incomplete, if they are confident that those providers will have the
                           necessary capabilities by the time they need them. We recommend that prospective customers
                           with immediate needs focus on finding the cloud provider that matches their anticipated
                           use cases for the next year. In some cases, businesses may have to use multiple cloud
                           IaaS providers to meet the needs of diverse use cases.

                        <p>Cloud IaaS is a computing resource, along with associated storage and network resources,
                           offered to the customer via self-service in a highly automated way, on-demand and
                           in near real time. In IaaS, the provider manages the data center facilities, hardware
                           and virtualization, but everything above the hypervisor layer — the operating system,
                           middleware and application — is managed by the customer, or is an add-on managed service
                           from the provider or another third party. This market is wholly separate and distinct
                           from cloud PaaS and SaaS.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cloud IaaS is owned, built and operated by a service provider, but it may be delivered
                           on-premises within a customer's data center or hosted in the provider's data center.
                           It may be "public" (multitenant) or "private" (single-tenant), although, in practice,
                           there is no consistency in the application of these labels to varying degrees of resource
                           isolation, and most hosted offerings use some degree of shared resources in services
                           labeled "private."

                        <p>Cloud IaaS is not a commoditized service, and
 even providers with very similar offerings
                           and underlying technologies often have 
sufficiently different implementations that
                           there is a material difference in 
availability, performance, security and service

Infrastructure as a Service" and its related reports to understand the

                        </h3>
                        <p>There are three broad categories of customer needs in cloud IaaS:</p>
                        <ul class="bullets_yes">
                           <li>The hosting of a single application, or a closely related group of applications</li>
                           <li>A VDC that will serve a broad range of different workloads</li>
                           <li>Batch computing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hosting is the most common need. For instance, a media company with a marketing microsite
                           for a movie, a software company offering SaaS and a retailer needing a lightweight
                           version of its e-commerce site for disaster-recovery purposes are examples of customers
                           with hosting needs that can be fulfilled by IaaS. These are generally production applications,
                           although there is some test and development as well. Some of these customers have
                           mission-critical needs, while others do not.
                        </p>
                        <p>Customers with a broad range of unrelated workloads are less common, but are growing
                           in importance, particularly in the midmarket, where IaaS is gradually replacing or
                           supplementing traditional data center infrastructure. The VDC is typically used very
                           similarly to the organization's internal virtualization environment — primarily for
                           less mission-critical production applications, or test and development environments
                           — but is increasingly being used to run more mission-critical applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>The least common need, but one that nevertheless generates significant revenue for
                           the small number of providers that serve this portion of the market, is batch computing.
                           For these customers, IaaS serves as a substitute for traditional HPC or grid computing.
                           Customer needs include rendering, video encoding, genetic sequencing, modeling and
                           simulation, numerical analysis and data analytics. Other than the need to access large
                           amounts of commodity compute at the lowest possible price, with little concern for
                           infrastructure reliability, these customers typically have needs very similar to those
                           of VDC customers, although some HPC use cases benefit from specialized hardware such
                           as GPUs and high-speed interconnects.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cloud IaaS can now be used to run most 
workloads, although not every provider can
                           run every type of workload well. Service 
providers are moving toward infrastructure platforms that can offer 
physical
                           (nonvirtualized) and virtual resources, 
priced according to the level of availability,
                           performance, security and isolation that the 
customer selects. This allows customers
                           to run both "cloud native" applications that 
have been architected with cloud transaction
                           processing principles in mind (see "From OLTP
 to Cloud TP: The Third Era of Transaction Processing Aims to the 
Cloud"), as well as to migrate existing business applications from their
 own virtualized
                           servers in internal data centers into the 
cloud, without changes. Cloud IaaS is best
                           used to enable new IT capabilities, but it 
has become a reasonable alternative to
                           an internal data center.

                        </h3>
                        <p><em>Cloud IaaS is not a commodity.</em> Providers vary significantly in their features, performance, cost and business terms.
                           Although in theory, cloud IaaS has very little lock-in — a VM is just a VM, in the
                           end — in truth, cloud IaaS is not merely a matter of hardware rental, but an entire
                           data center ecosystem as a service. This encompasses the entirety of the ITOM stack,
                           including traditional IT service management capabilities, DevOps-oriented capabilities,
                           and new forms of automation, analytics and insight, including "smart" infrastructure
                           capabilities that take advantage of the unique perspective offered by the delivery
                           of integrated compute, storage and networking resources. The more you use those capabilities,
                           the more value you will receive from the offering, but the more you will be tied to
                           that particular service offering. The dynamics of this market resemble a software
                           market, not a traditional IT services market. Providers are in a race to deliver features,
                           and the "winners" are likely to be those that are highly innovative and that have
                           the most resources to invest in the breadth and depth of capabilities development.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>The market is in a transition phase. </em>The first phase of the market's development, from 2006 to 2013, was marked by the
                           gradual maturation of the ability to offer infrastructure resources on a self-service
                           basis. By the end of this phase, customers could expect reasonably good delivery of
                           these capabilities from a large number of providers. But the most visionary providers
                           tried to provide customers with capabilities beyond mere infrastructure rental, reinventing
                           the relationship between infrastructure, applications, and management. In 2013, incumbent
                           IT vendors began acting aggressively to counter the threat of cloud computing to their
                           businesses. We have now entered a second phase in which providers will invest tremendous
                           resources in developing cloud services. There are promising new entrants. Furthermore,
                           providers that did well in the market's early years but have not kept up with the
                           pace of innovation are getting a second chance to pursue new strategies and reinvest
                           in engineering. Most such providers are likely to need two years to develop truly
                           competitive capabilities. During this transition phase, market share is likely to
                           continue to consolidate, but by the third phase of the market, in 2016 and beyond,
                           new strong competitors may emerge.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>There are many providers, but they vary widely in quality and capabilities.</em> There are many competitors in this market; new entrants continue to launch offerings
                           and existing providers are expanding the market segments they serve. Many of the newer
                           market entrants are very large IT companies with considerable sales reach, which could
                           potentially accelerate their growth; however, burdened by their legacy offerings,
                           they might not develop superior offerings. Broadly, providers can be divided into
                           two categories — those that are investing deeply in engineering in order to provide
                           a rich suite of features and extensive automation for self-service enablement, and
                           those that will provide only a basic set of IaaS features but intend to differentiate
                           in some other way, such as via managed services, PaaS or SaaS capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>The market's growth disproportionately favors the market leaders, and the market is
                              consolidating. </em>Many providers have solid offerings that encompass the most fundamental capability
                           in this market — the ability to provision VMs rapidly on-demand, coupled with storage
                           and an Internet connection. But most are finding it challenging to move beyond this
                           point, and are finding it increasingly difficult to grow or even maintain their customer
                           base. Customers' expectations are increasing, use cases are broadening, and many providers
                           have neither the ambition nor the resources to compete across the full breadth of
                           the addressable market.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Providers' size and scale matter. </em>While scale does impact operational efficiency to some degree, more importantly, it
                           impacts engineering efficiency — the ability to leverage an investment in developers
                           as well as partner capabilities across as large a customer base as possible. Software
                           requires a large upfront investment, but each incremental customer adds comparatively
                           little cost, and software markets tend to become "winner takes all" arenas, where
                           a small number of vendors command dominant market shares. Scale also matters because
                           the ability to deliver a broad range of integrated capabilities will become increasingly
                           crucial. A provider's size, its existing customer relationships, and the strength
                           of its brand have an enormous impact on its ability to gain market share and traction,
                           especially on a global basis. Furthermore, the solution ecosystem is rapidly consolidating
                           around a small number of market leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Customers are choosing IaaS platforms first, managed services second.</em> To deliver greater value to customers, cloud IaaS providers must improve the quality
                           and efficiency with which customers can manage their infrastructure. They must find
                           ways to reduce the burden of operational chores such as patch management and backups.
                           While manual managed services are frequently used to substitute for automated offerings,
                           efficiency demands automation instead of operators. Consequently, the choice of an
                           IaaS offering ultimately impacts the quality of the customer's IT operations. Customers
                           who want to outsource the management of their infrastructure will increasingly adopt
                           a best-in-class IaaS offering, and then seek a managed services provider to manage
                           it, rather than choosing to adopt a "managed cloud" offering from a managed services
                           provider that can offer only basic IaaS capabilities on its own platform. Customers
                           may extend existing outsourcing relationships to include management of a third-party
                           cloud IaaS offering.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Public and private cloud IaaS are converging. </em>Service
 providers are increasingly using dynamic physical and logical isolation
 mechanisms
                           to create "private" infrastructure within a 
shared, multitenant capacity pool. This
                           allows for economies of scale, while enabling
 customers to meet a broader range of
                           security and compliance requirements. See 
"Best Practice: Evaluate Isolation Mechanisms in Public and Private 
Cloud IaaS" for details on this convergence and how to choose the level 
of isolation you need.
                           We believe that, over time, the leading 
providers will offer a single, highly flexible
                           platform across both their own data centers 
and customers' data centers. As a result,
                           this Magic Quadrant covers not only public 
cloud IaaS, but standardized private cloud
                           IaaS as well.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Hybrid cloud is not yet a reality. </em>While it is relatively straightforward to move VM images from one cloud to another,
                           truly hybrid multicloud scenarios are rare. The tools to enable true "single pane
                           of glass" management and seamless movement across infrastructure platforms are not
                           mature, and there are significant differences in cloud IaaS implementations, even
                           between providers using the same underlying CMP. Note that the claim that an ecosystem
                           is "open" has nothing to do with actual portability. The organizations that use cloud
                           IaaS most effectively will embrace cloud-native management, rather than allow the
                           legacy enterprise environment to dictate their choices.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>IaaS and PaaS capabilities will overlap.</em> Cloud IaaS providers are increasingly offering middleware capabilities as a service,
                           and are likely to add capabilities such as the provisioning and orchestration of application
                           containers. Many leading providers will offer both IaaS and PaaS, and in many cases
                           will blend IaaS and PaaS capabilities. The spectrum of services allows customers to
                           decide on a trade-off between control and convenience. Customers want to develop,
                           deploy and manage applications efficiently, and will choose the combination of capabilities
                           that best suits their needs.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>The software-defined data center is the center of a partner ecosystem.</em> Programmatic (API) access to infrastructure is crucial, as it enables customers,
                           as well as third parties, to build management tools for their platforms, and to enable
                           applications to take maximum advantage of the infrastructure environment. Providers
                           need to foster rich ecosystems of capabilities. While the leading providers are likely
                           to build a substantial number of capabilities themselves, partners will extend the
                           range of their capabilities, provide overlays for complex heterogeneous multivendor
                           environments, and add "stickiness" to these platforms by offering tight integrations
                           between applications, middleware and infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Buying centers for IaaS are diverse.</em> The early adopters in the IaaS market were developers. As the market matures, developers
                           remain an important audience, because a great deal of IaaS adoption is business-led
                           — driven by business managers who hold the budget, need greater agility and have shorter
                           time frames than IT operations are able to accommodate, and who therefore turn to
                           application developers and enterprise architects for a solution. This is particularly
                           true for the single-application, "hosting" side of the market. IT operations is, however,
                           increasingly involved in IaaS sourcing, and is likely to be the primary buying center
                           for multiple-application needs. IaaS providers vary in their ability to target these
                           different buying centers. Furthermore, most providers focus on either a developer
                           audience or an IT operations audience, and their feature set and style of service
                           are oriented accordingly, although leading providers will increasingly offer capabilities
                           attractive to both audiences.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Local sourcing matters to some customers. </em>Customers normally prefer to keep data in-region for reasons of network latency. However,
                           regulatory concerns that require keeping data in-country, as well as revelations about
                           foreign intelligence agencies obtaining access to private data, have heightened the
                           desire of non-U.S.-based customers to purchase cloud IaaS from local providers. Unfortunately,
                           local providers typically lack the scale and capabilities of the global providers,
                           and may focus primarily on small businesses, not enterprises. Furthermore, keeping
                           data local is no guarantee of freedom from either domestic or foreign surveillance.
                           It is nevertheless possible that the cloud IaaS markets in Europe and Asia will become
                           highly fragmented, which may result in only basic, commodity capabilities being available
                           to customers that cannot use a foreign provider (even when that provider has local
                           presence).
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Public cloud IaaS provides adequate security for most workloads. </em>Although many security controls are the responsibility of the customer, not the provider,
                           most major cloud IaaS providers offer a high degree of security on the underlying
                           platform. Transparent encryption of LAN, WAN and storage will become increasingly
                           commonplace as a bundled element of cloud IaaS offerings, as providers react to defend
                           themselves against intrusion from government entities.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>Customers do not always save money by using cloud IaaS.</em>
 Although many customers first investigate using IaaS to achieve cost 
savings, most
                           customers buy IaaS to achieve greater 
business agility or access infrastructure capabilities
                           that they do not have within their own data 
center. IaaS can drive significant cost
                           savings when customers have short-term, 
seasonal, disaster recovery or batch-computing
                           needs. It can also be a boon to companies 
with limited access to capital and to small
                           companies, especially startups, that cannot 
afford to invest in infrastructure (see
                           "Cloud Computing Can Be the Singular Solution
 for at Least Five Use Cases"). For larger businesses with existing 
internal data centers, well-managed virtualized
                           infrastructure, efficient IT operations teams
 and a high degree of automation, IaaS
                           for steady-state workloads is often no less 
expensive, and may be more expensive,
                           than an internal private cloud. The less 
efficient your organization, the more likely
                           you are to save money by using a cloud 
provider, especially if you take advantage
                           of this opportunity to streamline and 
automate your operations. The largest-scale
                           providers are continually lowering their 
prices, and automated managed services will
                           substantially drive down the cost of 
infrastructure management over time, so cost
                           advantages will continue to accrue to the 
providers.
